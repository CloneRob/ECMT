The Software and the license herein granted shall not be copied, shared, distributed, made available, re-sold, offered for re-sale, transferred, assigned or sub-licensed in whole or in part except that you may make one copy for archive purposes only.

Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties

You expressly acknowledge and agree that the Software results from basic research, is provided “AS IS”, may contain errors, and that any use of the Software is at your sole risk. LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE SOFTWARE, NEITHER EXPRESS NOR IMPLIED, AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY LEGAL OR ACTUAL DEFECTS, WHETHER DISCOVERABLE OR NOT.

Limitation of Liability

Because this Software License Agreement qualifies as a donation, according to Section 521 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch – BGB) Licensor as a donor is liable for intent and gross negligence only. If the Licensor fraudulently conceals a legal or material defect, they are obliged to compensate the Licensee for the resulting damage.

Licensor shall be liable for loss of data only up to the amount of typical recovery costs which would have arisen had proper and regular data backup measures been taken.

For the avoidance of doubt Licensor shall be liable in accordance with the German Product Liability Act in the event of product liability. The foregoing applies also to Licensor’s legal representatives or assistants in performance. Any further liability shall be excluded.

Patent claims generated through the usage of the Software cannot be directed towards the copyright holders.

The Software is provided in the state of development the licensor defines. If modified or extended by Licensee, the Licensor makes no claims about the fitness of the Software and is not responsible for any problems such modifications cause.
